# Securing Your Django Site

This is a Django security talk I have given a few times at the San Diego
Python meetups and workshops.

## Highlights

* Basics: XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection
* Slightly more advanced: caching, pickle, passwords
* Double checking security exceptions
* New Django 1.4 and 1.5 stuff
* Django settings
* Settings not handled by Django

The fact that I used Impress.js and gave a mostly slide based presentation is not lost on me.
